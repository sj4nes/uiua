    use Primitive::*;
    view! {
        <h1 id="design">"Design"</h1>
        <p>"This page explains the reasons for some of Uiua's design decisions."</p>
        <p>"It serves as a "<a href="https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/more-software-projects-need-defenses-of-design-85ea9e23ffd85f5fde5a2d3d42001393cbce169a">"defense of design"</a>"."</p>

        <h2 id="stack-basing">"Stack Basing"</h2>
        <h3>"Combinators"</h3>
        <p>"When I first started developing Uiua, it was neither stack-based nor array-oriented. What it "<em>"did"</em>" focus a lot on was "<em>"combinators"</em>". I had this whole heirarchy of language-level operators that let you construct arbitrarily complex combinators relatively succinctly."</p>
        <p>"I discovered what a lot of others have discovered when delving deep into tacit code: it's really hard to read and write and reason about."</p>
        <p>"Eventually, I moved to a stack-based model and discovered that you can write almost any 1 or 2 argument combinator with just "<Prim prim=Dup/>", "<Prim prim=Over/>", and "<Prim prim=Flip/>"."</p>
        <p>"Of course, I also made the discovery that juggling 3 or more values on the stack also imposes a high cognitive load on the developer. This is especially true if you try to "<em>"rotate"</em>" the stack like you can with "<Prim prim=Roll/>" and "<Prim prim=Unroll/>", which are currently deprecated. "<Prim prim=Dip/>" replaced the rolling functions as it is more general and easier to reason about."</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>"Expressions"</h3>
        <p>"Long tacit expressions in most array languages can get very unwieldy. Because binary operations are infix, you have to parse the tree structure in your head before you can start determining the order of operations."</p>
        <p>"For example, in BQN, you can trim matches from the beginning of a string with "<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/bqncrate/?q=Remove%20cells%20that%20appear%20in%20x%20from%20beginning%20of%20y#"><code>"x(∧`∘∊˜¬⊸/⊢)y"</code></a>". "</p>
        <p>"In contrast, here is there equivalent in Uiua, implemented the same way:"</p>
        <Editor example="Trim ← ▽¬\\×∊,"/>
        <p>
            "You'll notice that stack basing simplifies the expression in a few ways:"
            <ul>
                <li>"There is no Uiua code corresponding to the BQN combinators "<code>"∘"</code>" and "<code>"⊸"</code>". Function composition is implicit."</li>
                <li>"Functions are executed right-to-left instead of in a tree ordering."</li>
                <li>"The expression does not require "<code>"()"</code>"s. In fact, no Uiua expression requires explicit grouping. "<code>"()"</code>" is used to make inline functions instead."</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>"I think this clarity makes writing long tacit expression much more workable."</p>

        <h2 id="array-model">"The Array Model"</h2>
        <p>"Uiua's array model went through a lot of iterations during development. At first, it used a flat, vector-based model ala K and Q. Then, I switched to BQN's Based array model. That was really complicated to implement primitives for, so I tried something else."</p>
        <p>"I switched to a flat array model with \"fill elements\". While arrays could not be nested, operations which would create nested arrays in other languages would instead create jagged arrays with special fill elements at the end of some rows. While this worked, the code was scattered everywhere with checks for fill elements, because they had to propogate through everything. It also had the unfortunate effect of making byte arrays take up 2 bytes of space, since a bit had to be used to indicate whether the byte was a fill element or not. Also, a lot of operations, such as "<Prim prim=Transpose/>", don't really make a lot of sense with jagged arrays."</p>
        <p>"Finally, I switched to the current model, which resembles J's Boxed array model. While you can do something resembling J's "<code>"box <"</code>" using "<Prim prim=Box/>" (and "<code>"open >"</code>" with "<Prim prim=Call/>"), I designed functions like "<Prim prim=Partition/>" and "<Prim prim=Group/>" to allow selecting uniformly-shaped rows from a non-uniform list in an effort to minimize interaction with jagged data."</p>
        <p>"The fact that the stack is always available also makes putting non-uniform data in arrays less necessary."</p>

        <h2 id="glyphs">"The Glyphs"</h2>
        <p>"Most of Uiua's glyphs were chosen for one of a few reasons:"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"It is a common mathematical symbol, such as "<Prim prim=Add/>", "<Prim prim=Sub/>", and "<Prim prim=Pi/>"."</li>
            <li>"It is a very commonly used function and should create little line noise, such as "<Prim prim=Dup/>" and "<Prim prim=Flip/>"."</li>
            <li>"It is used in other array languages, such as "<Prim prim=Reduce/>", "<Prim prim=Scan/>", and "<Prim prim=Transpose/>"."</li>
            <li>"It kind of reminds me of what it does. Some of my favorites are "<Prim prim=Table/>", "<Prim prim=Reshape/>", "<Prim prim=Rotate/>", "<Prim prim=Deshape/>", "<Prim prim=Find/>", and "<Prim prim=Recur/>"."</li>
            <li>"Its function is kind of abstract, but there are other related functions, so they all use related glyphs. For example, "<Prim prim=Fold/>" has this nice symmetry with "<Prim prim=Reduce/>" and "<Prim prim=Scan/>". The indexing/finding/grouping functions like"<Prim prim=Classify/>", "<Prim prim=Group/>", "<Prim prim=Deduplicate/>", etc are all circles."</li>
            <li>"I think they look like cute little guys: "<Prim prim=Assert/>" and "<Prim prim=Try/></li>
        </ul>
        <p>"An additional constraint is that every glyph must be present in the "<a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io">"DejaVu Sans Mono"</a>" font, which is the best-looking free monospace font I could find that supports the largest number of glyphs."</p>

        <h2 id="no-local-variables">"No Local Variables"</h2>
        <p>"Forbidding general local variables has a few benefits:"</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I don't have to implement them (score!)"</li>
            <li>"It forces you to write (often beautiful) tacit code, which I would argue Uiua enables better than almost any other programming language."</li>
            <li>"It frees you from the burden of naming things."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="identifiers-and-formatting">"Identifiers and Formatting"</h2>
        <p>"I made the decision to have a formatter that turns names into Unicode glyphs about as soon as I started using Unicode glyphs. I did not want to require special keyboard or editor support like APL and BQN do."</p>
        <p>"The advantage of a file-watching formatter is that the only feature your editor needs is the ability to automatically reload files if they change on disk. You don't need special keybinds or plugins or anything."</p>
        <p>"The other nice thing about a formatter is that it makes it easier to get started with the language. You do not have to memorize a bunch of keyboard shortcuts to type the glyphs. You just need to learn their names."</p>

        <h2 id="inspiration">"Inspiration"</h2>
        <h3>"BQN"</h3>
        <p>"The main language that inspired Uiua is "<a href="https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/">BQN</a>". While I had heard about APL before, BQN was my first real exposure to the power of the array paradigm. I think the language is an astounding feat of engineering. Marshall is both a genius and a great communicator."</p>
        <p>"However, as you can read above, a lot of Uiua's design decisions are responses to things I "<em>"didn't"</em>" like about BQN. There were a bunch of little pain-points that I though I could improve on."</p>
        <p>"A lot of the behavior of Uiua's built-in functions (and the choice of which built-ins to include) is inspired by BQN's primitives. Just a few examples are "<Prim prim=Transpose/>", "<Prim prim=Classify/>", "<Prim prim=Group/>", and "<Prim prim=Take/>"."</p>
        <p>"Another thing that was largely inspired by BQN is this website! BQN's site is excellent. I really like the way it is organized and the way it presents the language. I particularly liked the built-in editor, so I made my own version for Uiua that has syntax highlighting and history, which I reuse in all the tutorials and examples."</p>
        <br/>
        <h3>"The Array Cast"</h3>
        <p>"During the period of Uiua's development, I spent a lot of time listening to "<a href="https://arraycast.com/">"The Array Cast"</a>", a podcast about array languages. The conversations about the design and implementation of APL, J, K, Q, and BQN are both inspirational and informative. The guys have such a depth and breadth of knowledge on the topic. I really recommend giving it a listen."</p>
        <p>"Thanks to "<a href = "https://github.com/codereport">"Con"</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@code_report">"or"</a>", Bob, Stephen, Adám, "<a href="https://github.com/mlochbaum">"Marshall"</a>", Richard, and all the guests."</p>

        <h2>"The Interpreter"</h2>
        <p>"The Uiua interpreter is written in Rust."</p>
        <p>"An entire file is first parsed into an abstract syntax tree. Then, each line is, one after the other, compiled to a simple bytecode and executed."</p>
        <p>"Built-in functions are implemented in Rust so they can be as fast as possible. User defined functions are passed around as chunks of bytecode."</p>

        <h2>"Arrays"</h2>
        <p>"Values on the stack are implemented as Rust "<code>"enum"</code>"s, where each variant contains a different array type."</p>
        <p>"While the language itself only has 3 types, the interpreter has 1 extra: a byte array. IO streams and operations which have boolean results return byte arrays for space efficiency."</p>
        <p>"Array elements are stored in a reference-counted contiguous-memory container I call a "<em>"CowSlice"</em>" or clone-on-write slice. When an array is modified, its data is only copied if it is shared with another array. In addition, pulling out the rows of an array only increments the reference count of the data, and the row arrays have modified shapes and data offsets."</p>
        <p>"Array shapes are stored in a special array type that only allocates when there are more than 3 items."</p>

        <h2>"The Website"</h2>
        <p>"The Uiua website is written using the "<a href="https://leptos.dev/">Leptos</a>" framework and hosted on GitHub pages."</p>
        <p>"Leptos compiles to webassembly, which allows the entire Uiua interpreter to be compiled and used by the site's editor."</p>
        <p>"The online editor is implemented as a "<code>"contenteditable"</code>" div with lots of custom behaviors."</p>

        <p>"Once you have that, run the following command:"</p>
        <code class="code-block">"cargo install uiua"</code>
        <p>"If you want to enable audio output, enable the "<code>"audio"</code>" feature:"</p>
        <code class="code-block">"cargo install uiua --features audio"</code>

        <code class="code-block">"apt install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config"</code>

        <h2>"Basic Usage"</h2>
        <p>"Running just "<code>"uiua"</code>" will display the help message if there are no "<code>".ua"</code>" files in the directory."</p>
        <p>"You can initialize a "<code>"main.ua"</code>" with "<code>"uiua init"</code>"."</p>
        <p>"Once a "<code>".ua"</code>" file exists, running "<code>"uiua"</code>" will begin watching the directory for changes. If you edit and save a "<code>".ua"</code>" file, the interpreter will automatically format and run it."</p>
        <p>"You should configure you editor so that it automatically reloads files if they change on disk. This will allow you to see the formatted file as soon as it is saved."</p>
        <p>"Use "<code>"uiua run"</code>" to format and run a file without watching it."</p>
        <p>"Use "<code>"uiua fmt"</code>" to format a file without running it."</p>
        <p>"Use "<code>"uiua test"</code>" to run tests."</p>

        <h2>"Font"</h2>
        <p>"The Uiua glyphs were chosen to be compatible specifically with "<a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Download.html">"DejaVu Sans Mono"</a>". It is recommended that you install this font to get the best experience with Uiua."</p>

pub fn RightToLeft() -> impl IntoView {
    use Primitive::*;
    view! {
        <h2>"Right-to-Left"</h2>
        <p>"One of the most asked questions about Uiua is \"Why does code execute right-to-left?\" It's a valid question. Every other stack-oriented language I know goes left-to-right."</p>
        <p>"The simple answer is that while Uiua is stack-"<em>"based"</em>", it is not stack-"<em>"oriented"</em>"."</p>
        <p>"The misunderstanding is largely my own fault. The initial version of the website said \"stack-oriented\" everywhere and made references to FORTH. I have since rectified this."</p>
        <p>"When you write Uiua code the stack should just be a tool, a convention. It's how you pass values around. "<strong>"The stack should not guide how you think about solving problems in Uiua."</strong></p>
        <p>"Uiua is about composing arrays. The stack makes it possible to do this without naming local variables. This is the entire reason for its presence in the language. In particular, the stack can be used to construct arbitrary combinators and data flows. It is an extremely powerful mechanism for this purpose."</p>
        <p>"You should not think of Uiua syntax like a FORTH. You should think of it like a "<em>"Lisp"</em>". Sure, there are way fewer parentheses, but the structure is the same."</p>
        <p>"Consider this Uiua expression:"</p>
        <Editor example="≡(?∘⇌) ◿2⇡⧻. ↯∶⇡/×.4_4"/>
        <p>"The left side of the expression is "<em>"not"</em>" the end or the beginning. It is the "<em>"root"</em>". The expression is a tree with branches that converge and diverge in different ways. It is not a list of instructions."</p>
        <p>"This allows us to separate the execution model from the mental model. With a separate mental model, why does it matter which direction the code executes?"</p>
        <p>"The answer has to do with how left-to-right "<em>"natural"</em>" languages work. In English and the like, the verb in a sentence comes before the object it acts on. In addition, we often think of things in a procedural rather than a declarative way. If you think about using the "<Prim prim=Reverse/>" function on an array, you think of it as \"reversing the array\", not \"the array reversed\". It follows then that, like verbs, functions should come before their arguments."</p>
        <p>"This is a very SVO-language-centric way of thinking, and I think that's fine."</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>"Enough with the philosophical. There are also some syntactic reasons that left-to-right execution would be weird."</p>
        <p>"Consider some mathematical expressions:"</p>
        <Editor example="√4\n-3 5"/>
        <p>"The square root looks almost just like it does in mathematical notation. It would not be so if the "<Prim prim=Sqrt glyph_only=true/>" were to the right of the number. Similar problems arise with "<Prim prim=Neg glyph_only=true/>" and "<Prim prim=Not glyph_only=true/>"."</p>
        <p><code>"-3"</code>" has this nice quality where it kind of becomes its own little monadic function that also has a syntactic similarity to mathematical notation. You could do something similar if the language went the other way, with "<code>"5-"</code>", but subtracting is a more common and intuitive operation than subtracting from."</p>
        <p>"Consider the simple "<Prim prim=First/>" function:"</p>
        <Editor example="⊢[1 2 3]"/>
        <p>"The "<Prim prim=First glyph_only=true/>" glyph was chosen because it looks like it indicates the left side of a span (imagine some longer "<code>"⊢–––––⊣"</code>"). If it had to go on the right, there is no glyph that would indicate it quite so nicely. "<code>"⊣"</code>" has a similar aesthetic when put at the end, but that would indicate the last item rather than the first."</p>

        <Editor examples={&["%2", "◿1×220", "÷∶⇡.&asr"]}/>

        <p>"In this example, we make both a chord and a sequence from the same notes. We use "<Prim prim=Sin glyph_only=true/><Prim prim=Mul glyph_only=true/><Prim prim=Tau glyph_only=true/>" to make a sine wave instead of a saw wave."</p>
